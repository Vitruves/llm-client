      Extract the **drug-induced** side effects from the following patient drug review: ### {comment} ###. List the **drug-induced** side effects in **medical terms** (meddra) separated by comma, example : \"nausea,diarrhea,anxiety,intestinal_pain,chest_disconfort\" or "none" if no side effects. Your answer (only a list of english meddra medical terms separated by a comma):
